# Product Requirements

## Overview

Define the product you intend to deliver and the features you intend to include in your project. You don't have to include implementation details but have to include user stories that you might write that lead to the minimal viable product. 

The presentation doesn't have to match exactly what is in this assignment. This assignment is to help with brainstorming for the presentation and to help with developing the application.

**Note**: This assignment is a _group_ assignment and the same grade will be for the group. Please work in a group.
