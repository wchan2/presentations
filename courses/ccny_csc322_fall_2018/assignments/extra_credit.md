# Extra Credit Assignment

This assignment will be up to 5% of your final grade and is an individual assignment.

**Gather requirements** and **draw the UML diagrams** for the *Netflix* *MVP* after their DVD business. Think of all the aspects of the businesses. How does Netflix get their content? Who do they serve?

# Requirements Gathering

1. What problem does Netflix solve? How was life before Netflix was built? **10 points**
1. Who were the target audiences of Netflix? How do they differ from Youtube users for example? **10 points**
1. What are the technical requirements and technical user stories you need for your application before being able to work efficiently on the application? This will include deploying it to production. What kind of setup is necessary for that? Do some research and be detailed. **10 points**
1. What are the epics and user stories associated with the application? Include specific details and the acceptance criteria. **20 points**

*Hint*: A good litmus test is to ask yourself if you handed the epics and stories to an offshore team, will they understand how to implement the user story?

# UML Diagrams

After you have a rough architecture and design for your software, UML diagrams will help visually get on the same page. It is an executable plan to program your application.

## Use Case Diagrams

A good starting point for the use case diagrams is your user stories. After all that is written, document it using a use case diagram. One question to ask yourself that helps with drawing the use case diagrams is: what are the features and how does the user interact with your application?

Include all of the use cases that define your minimal viable product (MVP). **20 points**

## Sequence Diagram

The outline is will help you find out what workflows and interactions are important. You don't need to answer them but you need to be able to depict them in your diagrams. **20 points**

### Outline 

1. What are the components and how do they interact with each other?
1. What are the requests that user makes to your application?
1. What states and data are you storing for your application? Do you need a database?
1. What are the categories of the workflow?

*Note*: You can use different diagrams instead of putting everything in a single diagram. It could get complicated so make sure you categorize your flows.

## Class Diagram

This is to help with classes and think more specifically of the interactions in the sequence diagram. This should be structuring your classes. Be as detailed as possible to cover all the different steps of your MVP. 

Again you don't need to answer the questions in the outline but they are used to give some direction of what to document. **20 points**

### Outline

1. What is the architecture of your application? Some guidance to the this can be found on the slides. You don't have to adopt the exact architecture but it can help you structure your classes.
1. What are the classes of your application?
1. What are the relationships between your classes?
1. What are some interfaces that may be helpful for your application?
1. What are some abstract classes that may be helpful for your application?
