# Presentation Requirements

## Overview

Develop a quality software solution to a problem using software development methodologies, project management tools, 

## Goal

A product that you will feel proud of where you can talk about practices and answer questions using the **STAR** method during an interview

- Situation: What was the problem you tried to solve?
- Task: What were you tasked with?
- Action: How did you go about solving the problem? What software methodology, development techniques and design approach did you decide on and why?
- Result: What was the end result? What could be done better?

## General Guidance

- Stick to technologies you know to better meet project deadlines
    - *Exception*: introduce new technologies if the technologies you know don't solve your problem
- Develop a minimal viable product (MVP)
    - Think in iterations, develop a small set of features that minimally solves your problem to start

## Technical Requirements

1. Desktop or Web application
2. Connects to a database, it could be a relational or non-relational database

## General Presentation Guidelines

At a minimum, the presentation should include the following sections.

1. Product
    1. What is the product and what problem does it solve?
    2. What were the initial features you decided for the product?
    3. What were the remaining set of features you decided would make your MVP and why?
2. Planning
    1. What software development methodology did you choose? Why?
    2. What were some of the milestones that you set? Why?
    3. What are some tools your team decided to use? Why?
3. Requirements
    1. List the important user stories and breakdown of your project eg. login is standard and not important to the feature set but searching for a product to buy as part of an eCommerce application could be important
4. Technical Design
    1. UML Diagrams
        1. Use Case Diagram
        2. Class Diagram
        3. Sequence Diagram
5. Tests
    1. What did you decide to test?
    2. What approach did you use to test and why?
6. Demo: Show how a user might use your application
7. Retrospective
    1. Based on the above sections, what did you feel were useful and what did you wish you had known?
    2. Reflect on your experiences, did you feel like you had a better grasp or developing software to solve a given problem? Why or why not?
    3. How did you end up using the software development tools you used? Did you change the way you used the tools throughout the phase of the project?
    4. Did you change the way you worked, the requirements, etc while working on the project? Why?
    5. Did you have conflicts with team members? How did you work to resolve them?

## 360 Reviews Guidelines

Each member of the team will grade another member on the team. This is where you honestly grade each other based on contribution. _This will be modeled after the way performance reviews are done at most organizations_.

**Note**: Please don't grade individuals purely based on how technical someone else. Please put more emphasis into how proactive they are, how helpful they are and how much they actually contributed. Remember contributions are not always purely technical. Some examples could be, facilitating and helping the team improve communication, etc. _Try to give specific examples_.

1. What did the team member contribute to?
2. How did the team member contribute to the project?
3. Did you feel like the team member was inclusive? What did they do or didn't do to make you feel that way?
4. Would you work with this individual in a professional setting? Why or why not?
